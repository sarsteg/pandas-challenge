# Pandas Challenge

The project was completed as a part of UTSA Data Analytics and Visualization Program.

I was given the following prompt:

*"You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance."*

Additionally, I was provided:

* A dataset of students scores in their standardized test in mathematics and reading, and
* Starter code for a report on the school district's standardized test scores and budgeting.

In the report that I have created, I will personify the Chief Data Scientist role and present that information in a report-style (in contrast to the cell-by-cell format of the template).
